    A wedding Dj does so much more than show up and push play for a few hours.
    A Rockstar DJ sets the mood of your reception, controls the flow of the wedding, serves an the emcee, helps you pick the songs for the most important moments, covers for you when things get off schedule,
    and makes sure evreyone has a chance to bust a move!
    We understand that entrusting all this responsibility to a stranger can be stressful!
      <br>  <br>
